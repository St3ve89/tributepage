        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_(The_Last_of_Us)" target="blank">Ellie Williams</a> a brave, 14 year old girl, has grown up in this harsh world and it is all she has ever known. She’s an orphan who was raised in a boarding school
        run by the military within the bounds of the quarantine zone. Naïve and curious about the outside world, she is wise beyond her years and highly capable of taking care of herself and those around her. Obsessed with comic books, CDs, and other
        pop culture, her knowledge base is filled by the remnants of a world that no longer exists. </p>

    <p>Ellie was born sometime after the outbreak of the fungal pandemic. As a result, she grew up in an oppressive military Quarantine Zone in Boston, Massachusetts, with little knowledge of the world before infection. Before she died, Ellie's mother, Anna,
        asked Marlene to watch Ellie. However, Ellie never really met Marlene until she was 13 years old.</p>

    <p>In The Last of Us Part II, Ellie is now 19 years old and has a tattoo on her right arm. She plays an acoustic guitar and sings Through the Valley by Shawn James in an abandoned house. Joel enters the room and asks her, "What are you doing, kiddo?
        You really gonna go through with this?" Slowly putting the guitar down, Ellie replies, "I'm gonna find and I'm gonna kill every last one of them."</p>
